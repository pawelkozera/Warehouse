# Building Materials Warehouse Management System

This project is a Java and JavaFX-based application designed for managing a warehouse of building materials. It offers functionalities such as generating PDF invoices, utilizing an SQLite database, implementing a client-server architecture, employing Argon2 for password hashing, and leveraging various design patterns including Singleton, Strategy, and Abstract Factory.

## Features

- **PDF Invoice Generation**: Users can generate invoices in PDF format directly from the application, facilitating seamless transaction documentation.

- **SQLite Database**: The system utilizes SQLite as its database management system

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Implemented with a client-server model, allowing multiple users to access and manage the warehouse simultaneously while ensuring data integrity.

- **Argon2 Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using Argon2, a modern and secure password-hashing algorithm, enhancing system security.

- **Design Patterns**:
    - *Singleton*: Used to ensure only one instance of certain classes, optimizing resource usage and ensuring consistency.
    - *Strategy*: Employed to define various algorithms for handling different warehouse operations.
    - *Abstract Factory*: Facilitates the creation of families of related objects, providing flexibility in managing warehouse components.
